        <h2>WHAT IS A HEURISTIC EVALUATION?</h2>
        <h3>A lightweight evaluation that allows you to identify usability issues without the involvement of users.</h3>
        <p>In the 90's Jakob Nielsen put together a list of ten heuristics, or principles, that websites should adhere to. These heuristics are still very relevant today, and allow you analyze your website fairly cheaply relative to the cost of a user test.</p>
        <p>As a developer or designer, you should regard heuristic evaluations as an inexpensive sanity test to easily identify potential problems. Walk through your website and take a note of any UI elements that break any of Nielsen's 10 heuristics.</p>
        <p>Visit the Nielsen Norman Group's website for more articles on heuristic evaluations: <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/topic/heuristic-evaluation/"  target="_blank" onclick="trackOutboundLink('http://www.nngroup.com/topic/heuristic-evaluation/'); return false;" >http://www.nngroup.com/topic/heuristic-evaluation/</a></p>

        <div id="mobile_heuristics">
          <div class="mobile_heuristic">Visibility of system status</div>
          <div class="mobile_definition">
            The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.
          </div>
          <div class="mobile_heuristic">Match between system and the real world</div>
          <div class="mobile_definition">
            The system should speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.
          </div>
          <div class="mobile_heuristic">User control and freedom</div>
          <div class="mobile_definition">
              Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo.
            </div>
          <div class="mobile_heuristic">Consistency and standards</div>
          <div class="mobile_definition">
            Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions.
          </div>
          <div class="mobile_heuristic">Error prevention</div>
          <div class="mobile_definition">
            Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.
          </div>
          <div class="mobile_heuristic">Recognition rather than recall</div>
          <div class="mobile_definition">
            Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate.
          </div>
          <div class="mobile_heuristic">Flexibility and efficiency of use</div>
          <div class="mobile_definition">
            Accelerators -- unseen by the novice user -- may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.
          </div>
          <div class="mobile_heuristic">Aesthetic and minimalist design</div>
          <div class="mobile_definition">
            Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.

            recover from errors</div>
          <div class="mobile_definition">
            Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.

          <div class="mobile_heuristic">Help and documentation</div>
          <div class="mobile_definition">
            Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.
